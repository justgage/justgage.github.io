<h2>Stacks</h2>
<p>Stacks are funny data structures. They are like a queue, but backward. What is a queue then? A queue is like when you wait in line at the DMV. First come, first serve. You take a number then you can wait patiently and you will get helped eventually. In fact, the time you wait is a direct function of the number of people that came before you, that haven't been processed yet.</p>
<h2>Stacks, your worst DMV nightmare 😈</h2>
<p>Now imagine instead of first come first serve it's last come, first serve. Meaning that there's no more waiting patiently,</p>
<h2>hidden costs</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>time is much the same as with money. The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you're being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd feel like something was terribly wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...
But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work. Dealing with email, for example. You do it sitting at a desk. It's not fun. So it must be work.</p>
