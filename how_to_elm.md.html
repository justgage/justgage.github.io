        <h1>How to Elm</h1>
<p>This is a basic guide on how to learn Elm rather than actually teach you. I'm going to mostly link to resources that I feel are valuable and try to "teach you how to fish".</p>
<p>The main purpose is to accelerate your learning and save you a lot of googling and weeding through bad explinations.</p>

<h2>Learning Paths</h2>
<p>There is many different ways to learn Elm. Pick the one that best suits your learning style. With that said I feel that an interactive, "real-ish" project approach to be especially effective for me.</p>
<h3>Path 0: Make something (recommended)</h3>
<p>Assuming you're familiar with JavaScript and reasonably familiar with functional programming you should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read through the <a href="http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax" rel="noopener noreferrer">syntax guide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://runelm.io/c/dup" rel="noopener noreferrer">Start with a basic project example</a> that uses <code>Html.beginnerProgram</code></li>
<li>Start making a <strong>prototype</strong> of something (default: to-do list) doing <strong>no JS interop or http requests</strong>.</li>
<li>Refractor some things by changing the models type and following the compiler messages</li>
<li>Pull out some of the larger parts into new files like <code>View.elm</code> etc...</li>
<li>Get to the point it's basically done except for a HTTP request and learn about JSON decoding. I recommend using this: <a href="http://eeue56.github.io/json-to-elm/" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://eeue56.github.io/json-to-elm/</a> to do it automatically.</li>
<li>If this path didn't work for you make an issue or tell me in some way</li>
</ol>

<h2>A note to JavaScript developers (Especially React.js devs)</h2>
<h3>There is no spoon (components)</h3>
<p>Elm has some serious differences from JavaScript. One of such being <strong>there are no components</strong> only <em>view functions</em>. What is the difference? Well, a component is something that has <em>local state</em> and behaves independently. There is no local state in elm views.</p>
<p>Elm is a functional programming language and as such it's primary form of abstraction is pure functions. As such you should think of the view as a <em>projection</em> of the state of your app. A view literally transforms the model into HTML, that's it.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to try to organize your app <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be#.f9vs9hiv0" rel="noopener noreferrer">duck style</a> meaning grouping your app into many little model + view + update pieces and then finding a way to combine them together. Don't do that. Because Elm is 100% pure it doesn't allow side-effects which mean that you can't hide things like HTTP request, state updates, etc... inside your "duck". This means there's going to be a ton of wiring pushed up to the app that decides to use your ducks.</p>
<h3>The better way</h3>
<p>The better way is to define <strong>well-encapsulated Models</strong> that don't export their implementation with functions to work on it, then make view to show that state. I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8" rel="noopener noreferrer">this talk is the best explination of it</a>.</p>
<p>In a list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Model the state of the front-end in a clear and concice way</li>
<li>Use the view to transform that into html</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find that the view and the model end up looking quite different consider doing the <a href="https://medium.com/@ckoster22/upgrade-your-elm-views-with-selectors-1d8c8308b336#.4f96kkda8" rel="noopener noreferrer">"selector" pattern</a></p>
<p>remember:</p>
