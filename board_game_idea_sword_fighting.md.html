        <h1>Board game idea: sword fighting</h1>
<p>Amelia swordfight place blocks varying widths you have the right part is that hit Bell near Prince charming will have to place block or dodges can I see. Someone else will have to take some of the damage also you can move backwards out of the range of your opponent but also their stamina which limits how much you can do you want to in one turn. Maybe a natural way to model stamina is when you run out of cards you have to have a pause of a certain way for instance maybe you also have to have a pause of a certain width between each of your cards.</p>
