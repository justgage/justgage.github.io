<h2>The 7 Habbits of Highly <a href="http://localhost:5000/effective.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">effective</a> people</h2>
<ul>
<li>Individual:
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharpen the saw</strong>. Don‚Äôt work yourself to death. Strive for a sustainable lifestyle that affords you time to recuperate, recharge and be effective in the long-term.</li>
<li><strong>Be proactive</strong>. You have a natural need to wield influence on the world around you so don‚Äôt spend your time just reacting to external events and circumstances. Take charge and assume responsibility for your life.</li>
<li><strong>Begin with an end in mind</strong>. Don‚Äôt spend your life working aimlessly, tackling whatever job is at hand. Have a vision for the future and align your actions accordingly to make it into a reality.</li>
<li><strong>Put first things first</strong>. To prioritize your work, focus on what‚Äôs important, meaning the things that bring you closer to your vision of the future. Don‚Äôt get distracted by urgent but unimportant tasks.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Group:
5.  <strong>Think win-win</strong>. When negotiating with other, don‚Äôt try to get the biggest slice of the cake, but rather find a division that is acceptable to all parties. You will still get your fair share, and build strong positive relationships in the process.
6.  <strong>Seek first to understand, then to be understood</strong>. When someone presents us with a problem, we often jump right to giving a solution. This is a mistake. We should first take time to really listen to the other person and only then make recommendations.
7. <strong>Synergize</strong>. Adopt the guiding principle that in a group, the contributions of many will far exceed those of any individual. This will help you achieve goals you could never have reached on your own.</li>
</ul>
