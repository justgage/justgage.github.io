        <h1>2020-11-20T0611 - Information Quality</h1>
<p>Information Quality is the blanket term for these values:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avalibility</li>
<li>Discoverability</li>
<li>Relevance</li>
<li>Conciseness</li>
<li>Context Free</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll talk about each below:</p>
<h2>1. Avalibility</h2>
<p>Everyone has the ability to <em><strong>access</strong></em> as much information as possible without running into permission walls or information silos. This includes decisions, discussions, code documentation, company rules, etc... This is often <a href="https://justgage.github.io/shy_of_public_channels.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">not the default</a> in <a href="https://justgage.github.io/synchronous_communication.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synchronous Communication</a>, mainly because people tend to be <a href="https://justgage.github.io/shy_of_public_channels.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">shy of public channels</a>.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://justgage.github.io/information_availability.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information Availability</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Discoverability</h2>
<p>Information is only useful <a href="https://justgage.github.io/slack_is_a_black_hole_of_information.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">if you can find it</a>. Being able to quickly find information is just as important as having it. If information is unstructured, it'll be unlikely to ever be.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://justgage.github.io/information_discoverability.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information Discoverability</a></p>
<h2>3. Relevance</h2>
<p>Information is showing up at the right time to the right person (in terms of notifications). There's lots of things that can interfere with this such as having <a href="https://justgage.github.io/small_amount_of_categories_that_are_infinitely_deep.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">small amount of categories that are infinitely deep</a> or [[Notion#^ceff68|when there's no clear "publish" time]].</p>
<h2>4. Conciseness</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.‚Äù ‚Äï Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing concisely is hard. Yet we should not <a href="https://justgage.github.io/force_the_user_to_read_everything.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">force the user to read everything</a> or be <a href="https://justgage.github.io/slack_is_hostile_for_the_reader.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">hostile to the reader</a></p>
<p>Also skimming should be possible, which is why <a href="https://justgage.github.io/the_power_of_a_title.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">The power of a title</a> is so important.</p>
<h2>5. Context Free</h2>
<p>Got this one from <a href="https://justgage.github.io/gitlab's_handbook_first_approach.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gitlab's Handbook first approach</a>, but when you do <a href="https://justgage.github.io/asynchronous_communication.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asynchronous Communication</a> [[Asynchronous communication, The cure to notification overload (Youtube)#^11b40c|you should avoid the need for "context"]]. By Context I mean, that even a new hire would know what you're talking about, <a href="https://justgage.github.io/a.s.s_acronyms_seriously_suck_-_elon_muskraw.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid achronyms</a>, and talk in a way that you didn't have to "be there".</p>
<p>A good example is in the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/gitlab_meetup_on_async_communication_youtube.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gitlab meetup on Async communication (Youtube)</a> where she talks about a co-worker that asked,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"could you respond to Shane's question?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>but in reality should have said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Could you respond to shane's question in the <code>#all-remote</code> channel with your avalibility"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Longer? Yes. Took longer to write? Yes. But the benefit is that it <strong>doesn't require follow up questions</strong> which is important if you want to have <a href="https://justgage.github.io/asynchronous_communication,_the_cure_to_notification_overload_youtube.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">cure notification overload</a>, and also just has a longer "shelf life", meaning that you'll understand the data even a year from now and don't have to rely on <a href="https://justgage.github.io/tribal_knowlege.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tribal Knowlege</a>.</p>
