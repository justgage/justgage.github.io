        <h1>Slack like a meandering walk through the woods</h1>
<p>Slack is kind of like a long meandering walk through the woods. You are just constantly moving forward so you have no time to really get to know the territory just constantly seeing new things which all start to look the same after a while. If somebody ask you where you saw that bear at you could maybe describing a little bit but you would have to take a long meandering walk to find it again. Hopefully you would know it when you saw it but because your brain hasn't had enough time to memorize it's placement and it's constantly being replaced by new things it's unlikely you're ever going to see that again.</p>
