        <h1>The negativity people on you do new things and opportunity costs</h1>
<p>People tend to get very negative when you trying to do new things telling you all the reasons that it's going to be worse. there is probably many reasons for this but one of the reasons is probably because they don't think about the opportunity cost of sticking with what they're currently doing. They assume that the only risk is in trying something new. in reality there's a risk and not trying anything new namely you'll miss out on opportunities that you never tried.</p>
