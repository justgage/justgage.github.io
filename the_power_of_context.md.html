title: The power of context</h2>
<ul>
<li>the most powerful thing a programmer can have is <a href="http://localhost:5000/context.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Context</a> meaning they know which files to go to and where things are kept, why code behaves a particular way, why a feature exists. It can make them 10x more productive due to how much time is wasted just trying to carefully understand the application so you can make a change to it. Making the change is almost always the easy part. This usually divides the senior programmers from the junior.</li>
<li>this also applies to strategy. Knowing why we should build something and what the customers are thinking is everything.</li>
<li>my method of writing down <a href="http://localhost:5000/moc.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOC</a>s for the code, eg: how the feature works, helps me move faster in the end because I can't keep all those file locations in my head. The VSCode extension for bookmarks helps with this too.</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:5000/gitlab.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gitlab</a>'s right about this, context matters a ton</li>
<li>We really are knowledge workers</li>
<li>Good code is code who's APIs you can <a href="http://localhost:5000/easily_fit_into_your_head.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">easily fit into your head</a>.</li>
<li>Most communication is about sharing context by requesting it from peoples brains, often the only place it's stored. <a href="http://localhost:5000/tribal_knowledge.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tribal Knowledge</a>.</li>
