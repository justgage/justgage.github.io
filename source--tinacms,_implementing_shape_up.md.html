<p>An endless <a href="https://justgage.github.io/neverending_sprints.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">sprint</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>without a formal objective the team might be trying to <strong><a href="https://justgage.github.io/essentialism,_focusing_energy.png" rel="noopener noreferrer">make progress in a dozen directions</a></strong>, almost ensuring that no progress was being made in any direction.</p>
<p>The system we created made <strong>distraction a natural tendency</strong>, and fighting against that tendency was an exhausting exercise.</p>
<p>The problem with this lack of structure was our productivity was <strong>decided mostly by luck</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also talked about how there's no formal process to bring up new ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There was no formal way to <a href="https://justgage.github.io/pitches.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">bring up new ideas</a></strong>: When multiple projects of various length are being run at once, each with <a href="https://justgage.github.io/overlapping_timelines.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">overlapping timelines</a>, then there is no good time to bring up new ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They talk about how without a <a href="https://justgage.github.io/timebox.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">timebox</a> things took far longer than expected. Nobody really made sure each piece was worth working on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Work expands to fill the time allotted for it</strong>: Projects didn't have deadlines. They were done when they were done. Some projects dragged on for weeks longer then we expected. Some projects were cut short. There was never a conversation about how much a project was really worth</p>
</blockquote>
