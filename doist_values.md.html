<h2>1. Independence</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Others can trust that you’ll deliver on time and your teammates don’t need to worry about you keeping your word. You can easily manage your work and remain accountable with little or no direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2. Mastery</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You love what you do and care deeply about the quality of your work, down to the smallest details. You’re continuously learning and always pushing yourself to the limits of your ability. You’re never satisfied with the status-quo.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>3. Communication</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your communication is clear, concise, and engaging whether you’re explaining a complex idea or providing feedback to a teammate. You keep others in the loop and never go radio silent. You’re culturally and socially aware and can appropriately navigate different types of social interactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>4. Ambition &amp; Balance</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You aspire to put a dent in the universe. To do this, you set high standards for yourself and those around you. The time you spend on work isn’t measured by quantity, but by quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>5. Impact</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re able to take a bird’s eye view to pinpoint and then solve issues that have a high impact on our customers, our team, and our company. You’re committed to the health and success of both your teammates and Doist as a company.</p>
