        <h1>Roam's Model Sucks for Mobile</h1>
<ul>
<li>Bullet Points aren't really mobile friendly
<ul>
<li>You can't drag them very easily</li>
<li>There's no "Tab" key</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wiki Links aren't easy to type
<ul>
<li><code>[[</code> is really hard to get to on a mobile keyboard. Most people probably don't even know how to</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>References V.S. Embeds are too complex and <a href="https://justgage.github.io/fiddly.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">fiddly</a>
<ul>
<li>What most people want to do is just collect a bunch of ideas and eventually turn them into something new.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moving around text is really hard because text selection is hard.</li>
<li>Doing secondary actions on a paragraph doesn't work because it would cause the text to select. You could click on the bullet, but this would be likewise difficult and counter intuitive and tricky.</li>
<li>Trying to insert your cursor between two paragraphs is hard(ish)</li>
<li>Roam is all about combing information and doing some serious transformations on them, mobile doesn't offer much screen real estate to see much information at once.</li>
<li>Searching by typing is awkward, although perhaps still the most accurate.</li>
<li>Roam is a web app so it's limited by the browser.</li>
</ul>
