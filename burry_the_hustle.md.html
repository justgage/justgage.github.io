        <h1>Burry the hustle</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Its origin from a dog-eat-dog world has been turned from a cautionary tale into an inspirational one. It’s not that you need to hustle to survive, it’s that you seek the hustle to thrive, and still at the expense of yourself and others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What really gets my goat, though, is that it doesn’t even work. You’re not very likely to find that key insight or breakthrough idea north of the 14th hour. <strong>Creativity, progress, and impact does not yield easily or commonly to brute force</strong>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>cheat sheet and counter to the hustle:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get a great night’s sleep. The studies on sleep deprivation and its cognitive effects are unanimous and devastating. You take a bigger hit on your productive and creative powers through lack of proper sleep than almost any other neglect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get plenty of fresh air. The latest studies on effects of CO2 accumulation, volatile organic compounds, and other indoor air quality killers are shocking. And unlike sleep, it’s far less known just how much cognitive impairment you can suffer from poor air quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get regular exercise. This isn’t about “staying fit” or “looking good”, although those are noble reasons in their own right. It’s about what moving your body does to your brain. And it’s good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read some classics. You probably read the equivalent of a few books a month in tweets, hot takes, and other low-calorie material. What if you shifted some of that consumption to not just what’s most recent, but the best humankind had to offer over the last few millennia? The influences compound and tickle your creativity in profound ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say no to more dumb shit. Engage with fewer things but at a higher intensity. Stick with it. Stop chasing so much.</p>
</li>
