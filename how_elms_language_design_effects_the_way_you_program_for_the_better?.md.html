<h2>Language design effects you</h2>
<p>The language you speak effects you. It's perhaps hard to believe, after you're just using different words right? I can say "Hello!" in English and I can say "hola!" that makes no difference right?</p>
<p>In this case I think not but languages are not 1-to-1, there's words that exist in Spanish that don't exist in English (and vice-versa),  one language can make an idea or feeling easier to express while another harder. The effect might be that you express yourself less one way than in another. English doesn't have a way to say "I love you" to another guy and not make it sound weird, however if there was a word for brotherly love, then this may not have been weird at all.  Programming languages are the same way.</p>
<h1>JavaScript effects how you program</h1>
<p><a href="https://justgage.github.io/elm.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elm</a> is a replacement for JavaScript so in many ways it makes sense to look at it first. JavaScript historically as many of you know was coined as a "Language for Designers and New people" it was what you would use if you just wanted to add a little bit of functionality here and there. Form validation for instance or other small tasks. The idea is you would make a Java servlet if you where going to do anything serious. Naturally a lot has changed sense then. With ES6 and beyond it's evolved into a much more serious language.</p>
<p>How does JavaScript affect the way you think?</p>
<h2>There's Objects, then there's Arrays, maybe some numbers and booleans.</h2>
<p>In JavaScript there's not great ways to create new data structures. While it may have been <em>kind of</em> object oriented, it's very uncommon for people to create new data structures a lot. Why is this? Well the problem is Objects and Arrays are the only ones that have a literal syntax, meaning they are the only ones you can just type <code>[]</code> and <code>{}</code> and create them on the fly. They are easy to visualize because of this. The dynamic typing of JavaScript also makes it hard to know what functions you can run on new data-structures, it also makes it hard to introspect and view what's going on inside them. Overall this means, we use them for everything.</p>
<p><a href="https://justgage.github.io/elm.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elm</a> makes it relatively easy to make new data-structures, the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/static_typing.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Static Typing</a> makes it was to know what a function takes and what it returns. As such we have NonEmtyList, RemoteData, Html, etc...</p>
