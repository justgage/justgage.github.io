<h1>Slack is Social Media</h1>
<p>I loved playing with toys as a kid, however when I was done I hated having to put them away. It was so boring, yet my parents seemed to be quite infatic about it's importance, stepping on legos and all. So I came up with a compromise! <strong>What if I could play with my toys <em>while</em> I put them away?!?</strong> My main method would be to would put a toy on a racecar then race it around the room ultimately placing it in the toy bin. I theorised that I could repeat this process till all the toys were put away and would enjoy myself much more.</p>
<p>My parents were not too impressed though. My productivity when it came to putting away toys may have been more fun, but it was also slower by a huge factor. Turns out putting a single toy away one-by-one slowly rather than grabbing handfulls as fast as I could (because I hated it) was a lot slower. I had a really hard time seeing this productivity gap.</p>
<p>Not only that, but when you're having fun it's hard not to get distracted by the coolness of the toy I was putting away. Hence the mystery was solved of why my parents would come back just in time to see me put a toy in the bucket, however the rest of the room looked exactly the same.</p>
<p>While this may seem to be only a childish feeling, kids are easiliy distracted and use fun as their fuel after all, I belive Adults aren't all that different. We <em>all</em> like to do things the fun way rather than the fast way, espessially when we <em><strong>don't realize</strong> it's any slower.</em></p>
