        <h1>forget you're paying model</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://justgage.github.io/dark_pattern.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Pattern</a> in my opinion where you take their credit card, give them a "free trial" which at it's completion will subscribe them. The reason this works is it takes away the pain of, "I'm aware my money is going away", but the downside is that you're silently sucking their money away without them realizing it till it's too late. I mean for many people it probably helps them get over the fact that paying for software isn't a thing they're used to but at the same time it just feels morally wrong. I often will avoid the free trial entirely because I'm afraid that I'll forget. I don't even try it. Which is contrary to the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/drug_dealer_model.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drug dealer model</a>.</p>
