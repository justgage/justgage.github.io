<blockquote>
<p>few years ago I used to be a hothead. Whenever anyone said anything, I’d think of a way to disagree. I’d push back hard if something didn’t fit my world-view.</p>
<p>It’s like I had to be first with an opinion – <strong>as if being first meant something</strong>. But what it really meant was that I wasn’t thinking hard enough about the problem. <strong>The faster you react, the less you think</strong>. Not always, but often.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I often think we do this because we want to <a href="https://justgage.github.io/have_a_seat_at_the_table.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">have a seat at the table</a>.  And we think that having an already formed opinion somehow makes us a more put together person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He said “Man, give it five minutes.” I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it’s fine to disagree, <em>it’s fine to push back, it’s great to have strong opinions and beliefs</em>, but <strong>give my ideas some time to set in before you’re sure you want to argue against them</strong>. “Five minutes” represented “think”, not react. He was totally right. <strong>I came into the discussion <a href="https://justgage.github.io/looking_to_prove_something,_not_learn_something.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">looking to prove something, not learn something</a>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really proves to me that [[Basecamp Guide to Internal Communication#^612230|rushing makes conversation worse]] and <a href="https://justgage.github.io/rushing_means_you_don't_care.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">rushing means you don't care</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s also a difference between asking questions and pushing back. Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means you want to know. <strong>Ask more questions</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also references:</p>
<h1>Steve Jobs, Ideas are easily squished <a href="https://justgage.github.io/steve_jobs,_ideas_are_easily_squished.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">🔖</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people’s money and 2. Dismissing an idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow! So good!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn’t involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That’s easy. <strong>The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it.</strong> ==The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea==</p>
</blockquote>
<p>^182dc2</p>
<p>It's way too easy to not let ideas come to the surface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too much work. Those things may be true, but <strong>there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.</strong></p>
