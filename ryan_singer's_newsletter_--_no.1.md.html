<p>He was talking about <a href="https://feltpresence.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c42f783ec054f9deb3f109216&amp;id=8b7c8d99f4&amp;e=cf591c28a8" rel="noopener noreferrer">a conversation he had</a> where people were arguing that everyone should be involved in deciding what to do next.

</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
