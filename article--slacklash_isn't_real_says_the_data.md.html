<h3>Group Chat is Most popular</h3>
<p><a href="https://justgage.github.io/group_chat.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Group chat</a>/<a href="https://justgage.github.io/slack.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> is by far the most popular way to communicate. (Only 1/10 dislike using it, I guess I'm exceptional)</p>
<p><img src="https://justgage.github.io/chat-is-peoples-favorite.png" alt="chat-is-peoples-favorite"></p>
<p><strong>My Thoughts</strong>: This doesn't surprise me. <a href="https://justgage.github.io/slack_won_because_it_was_fun.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack won because it was fun</a>, and as such it's great for it. The <a href="https://justgage.github.io/slack's_gif_problem.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GIFs</a>, the Emojis, the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/email's_overly_formal_problem.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">casualness</a>. That's not really my beef with <a href="https://justgage.github.io/slack.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a>, it has more to deal with the fact that it tends to be <a href="https://justgage.github.io/slack_is_a_black_hole_of_information.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">be the only tool people want to use even when it's a bad fit</a> Slack, and Group Chat tend to <a href="https://justgage.github.io/chat_is_like_renting,_documentation_is_like_owning.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">be a bad investment in the long run</a>.</p>
<h3>People feel like Group Chat is less distracting than E-mail</h3>
<p>And most people don't feel it's distracting, generally less than email!</p>
<p><img src="https://justgage.github.io/email-is-more-distracting-than-slack.png" alt="email-is-more-distracting-than-slack"></p>
<p><strong>My Thoughts</strong>: Also not too surprising Slack doesn't really have the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/email_marketing_spam_problem.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Email marketing spam problem</a> so it's unlikely that Slack is going to be worse in terms of distracting and useless content. At least Slack's stuff is <em>generally</em> from real people.</p>
<h3>Email feels most productive</h3>
<p>However, when people talked about <em>productivity</em> <a href="https://justgage.github.io/email.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">email</a> won out.</p>
<p><img src="https://justgage.github.io/email-is-most-productive.png" alt="email-is-most-productive"></p>
<p><strong>My Thoughts</strong>: This also makes sense, E-mail may not be hip and cool but it is <a href="https://justgage.github.io/asynchronous_communication.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asynchronous Communication</a> and also has <a href="https://justgage.github.io/power_of_a_title.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">a title</a> which means it's far more easier to find later and stays on the topic of the first email far more.</p>
<p>I do think that email goes bad when <a href="https://justgage.github.io/email_becomes_chat.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">email becomes chat</a>, which often happens when your company forces you to turn on your notifications and writes email hastily.</p>
<h3><a href="https://justgage.github.io/fomo.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">FOMO</a> is Real</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThey can definitely be distracting, and FOMO [fear of missing out] is real when you come back from time off and see weeks‚Äô worth of unread chats.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>My Thoughts</strong>: Yeah 100%, this is a huge problem, it's why <a href="https://justgage.github.io/article--is_group_chat_making_you_sweat.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">group chat is stressfull</a>, it doesn't let you disconnect.</p>
