<h2>Why Reusability?</h2>
<h3>When it goes Good</h3>
<ol>
<li>Eases later implementations (hopefully)</li>
<li>Might make calling code much more readable.</li>
<li>Less lines of code overall (hopefully)</li>
<li><strong>Work at a higher level,</strong> if you feel like you're writing the same code over and over, STOP! You're wasting your time.</li>
</ol>
<h3>When it goes Bad</h3>
<ol>
<li>It might not end up being that reusable</li>
<li>It might make it less readable</li>
<li>It can be time consuming</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Ugly</h3>
<ol>
<li>It can make code very hard to understand</li>
<li>Makes code very indirect and hard to follow</li>
</ol>
<h2>Word of caution...</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However to that I say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being afraid of making the wrong abstraction is a poor excuse to never do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the real problem is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Being abstract is something profoundly <strong>different from being vague</strong>‚Ä¶ The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How to make things reusable?</h2>
<h3>0. Recognize Duplication</h3>
<p>If you see some code that's just <strong>feels</strong> like you've written it before or you've seen it before, just look for it!</p>
<pre><code>* Have you written your own component for something that looks very similar on another page?
</code></pre>
<h3>1. Smaller Abstraction</h3>
<p><strong>SRP</strong></p>
<p>Think Single Responsibility principle!</p>
<p>Tell-tell signs you're doing it wrong:
1. You add arguments for new use cases (read_message)
2. You have to name it with "and" <code>UserCanDoThisAndThat</code> <code>CreateMessageAndSendEmail</code></p>
<h3>2. Make API's easy to remember and use</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The best modules are deep: <strong>they have a lot of functionality hidden behind a simple interface.</strong> A deep module is a good abstraction because only a small fraction of its internal complexity is visible to its users. A shallow module is one whose interface is relatively complex in comparison to the functionality that it provides.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. Reusable Naming</h3>
<h3>4. Good documentation</h3>
<h3>5. Good code organization</h3>
<h3>6. Tell people about it!</h3>
<h3>7. Use the platform</h3>
<p>Know the standard lib! Using an esoteric standard lib function is <strong>good</strong> you might not know it yet, but you can learn. Thousands of libraries? Not so good.</p>
