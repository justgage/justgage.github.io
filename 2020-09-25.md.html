<p>Today was a PM day for sure. I just started looking into the watch issue that Paul messaged me about, but before that I was doing a lot of project organization stuff. <strong>I‚Äôve noticed the the planning boards have become more like trash receptacles</strong>. They have <strong>so many issues</strong> in them and <strong>it is so disorganized</strong>, the pretty much <strong>80% of the tickets that are created there will stay there for a long time</strong>. I hopped on a call with Spencer and we sorted through the current S2's and defined whether they were really ready for the next sprint or if they should be put in the backlog.
<br>
I‚Äôm hoping that if we can keep the planning boards cleaner, we can have more effective planning meetings, and <strong>we can actually get reported stuff fixed instead of it being lost in an array of bugs</strong>. Planning on meeting with Spencer and Justin weekly to do a planning review and making sure things are prioritized and ready for sprint planning on Mondays.</p>

<li>So there's real pain around managing the <a href="http://localhost:5000/backlogs.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">backlog</a> of bugs.</li>
<li>People just <a href="http://localhost:5000/slack_encourages_dumping.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">dump</a> things there but never look at them</li>
