        <h1>Would you rather use Google Docs</h1>
<p>When talking about <a href="http://localhost:5000/clickup.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClickUp</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJGt5BUTK0I" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lady realized</a> that she started to get <a href="http://localhost:5000/stress.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stress</a>ed and reverted to using a Google doc instead of using the tool she committed to.</p>
<p>I think this happens because She got overwhelmed and when it comes to Project Management, <a href="http://localhost:5000/simplicity_freaking_matters.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simplicity freaking matters</a>. Google docs was simple and didn't get in her way. She understood all the parts of it and therefore it was comfortable. I feel this way about <a href="http://localhost:5000/basecamp.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp</a> as well. When I used it it focused me. All the ADD of configuring went away because my brain knew there wasn't any to be had.</p>
<p>Not only that configuring is a two edge sword because once you've configured a system you've essentially programmed it. It's hard to un-program it and it's unlikely you'll do a good job on your first try. I trust people that have thought about problems a lot more than I do than the idea that I had a few minutes into using a tool. Even if I've thought about a problem for months they've thought about them for years.</p>
<p>When there's only one thing to do... you do it.</p>
