<blockquote>
<p>Kate Lunau, Canada editor
So, I felt waaaaaay less frantic on Monday and Tuesday, ie the early days of no Slack. Like, there wasn't a <strong>constant buzzing and humming behind me that needed my attention</strong>. But Jordan and I definitely felt sort of <em>cut off from the rest of Motherboard.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>It's hard to not use Slack</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Adrianne Jeffries</strong>:
Do you think you will use Slack differently now?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Kate Lunau</strong>:
I feel like‚Ä¶ no? Because, you know, whenever you do a "detox" you make resolutions but they never actually work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems like <a href="https://justgage.github.io/slack_addiction.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack Addiction</a>.</p>
<h2>Team #NeverSlack</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I think enabling do not disturb is a false question, it's kind of like encryption. You can't trust the user to enable it. If something is happening in Slack i want to know what's happening because I care about the site, so I read every message in Slack regardless of where it's put or who says it. <strong>The longest I can go without checking it even if I'm incredibly busy is probably 10-15 minutes</strong>, which may be a personal attention problem but <strong>by design that's how the service is made to work.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://justgage.github.io/something_is_always_going_on_in_slack.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Something is ALWAYS going on in Slack</a> and often I'll like, come in and see that I missed some discussion and will disagree with where we left it or have something to add and it's too late. Really I probably don't NEED to weigh in but that's <strong>kind of what chat apps train you to do</strong>, is to say things to the people who are saying things to the group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of [[Source--Is Group Chat Making You Sweat#7 Pile-ons and devolving conversations]]</p>
<h2>Slack masks bad Org hierarchies</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Stopping Slack has been a chance to reverse out of the cul-de-sac and say, hey, how does this system actually work? I think that's probably the <strong>biggest allure of Slack and the reason people hate it so much. It makes limping along with a terrible hierarchy and structure possible, so you don't have to solve inherent problems</strong> to your staff model. And then <a href="https://justgage.github.io/force_the_user_to_read_everything.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">everyone has to pay attention to everything</a> and they all go insane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In summary Slack masks real problems by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making conversations happen faster <a href="https://justgage.github.io/source--sustainability_over_speed,_adopting_asynchronous_communication.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source--Sustainability over speed, adopting asynchronous communication</a></li>
<li>Not worry about getting the right information to the right people but rather just tell everything to everyone. (See <a href="https://justgage.github.io/slack_is_hostile_for_the_reader.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack is hostile for the reader</a>/<a href="https://justgage.github.io/slack_is_optimized_for_the_writer.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack is optimized for the writer</a>)</li>
