        <h1>Handling LastSeenAt/LastSeenUrl</h1>
<p>LastSeenAt is a value that's constantly updating and as such it seems too expensive and probably not worth it to store that in the event store.</p>
<h2>What do people really want</h2>
<ol>
<li>Know <strong>where</strong> the widget  is installed</li>
<li>Know <strong>if</strong> the widget is installed</li>
<li>Know if the widget has <strong>broken</strong> (kind of a late indicator)</li>
<li>Know if the widget is installed in <strong>multiple places &amp; they aren't paying</strong> for that.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Short-term solution</h2>
<p>The only use case right now is number <strong>1</strong> (and kind of <strong>2</strong>, although not in a very convenient format)</p>
<p>So to maintain this functionality we just store it outside of the event store in Redis. This is ok because this data is also stored in Kafka/S3 in our analytic data and even then it's not that hard to get it back because HTTP requests are constantly flowing into MindFlayer.</p>
<h2>Long-term solution: Idea 1</h2>
<p>It would be awesome to have reports of a widget being installed on multiple websites and compare that to the <code>webchat_limit</code> (not yet a thing)  to let throw up flags in Skyhook to ask people for more money..</p>
<p>This also would be nice to know all the places a config change will affect.</p>
<h2>Idea 2</h2>
<p>Save "Installed on", a list of unique domains it's installed on.</p>
<p>Also if we were able to scope by domain name that would also help us out.</p>
