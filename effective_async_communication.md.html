        <h1>Effective Async Communication</h1>
<p>Asynchronous, what a nerdy word. If you don't know what it means let's start with a definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Not simultaneous or concurrent in time</em>\</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples of&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://justgage.github.io/synchronous.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synchronous</a> Communication</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video Calls (Zoom, Google Meet, etc...)</li>
<li>Audio Calls (Teleconferences)</li>
<li>Slack (usually, see below)</li>
<li>Live talks or Events</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of&nbsp;<strong>Asynchronous</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Communication</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Management Tools (JIRA, Basecamp, Asana)</li>
<li>Stack Overflow</li>
<li>In-App comments (Google docs comments, comments in Abstract, etc...)</li>
<li>E-mail (unless you're using it like chat, don't do this)</li>
<li>Surveys</li>
<li>Forums (like&nbsp;<a href="https://elixirforum.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://elixirforum.com</a>)</li>
<li>Github/Gitlab issues</li>
<li>Marco Pollo (a unique async video chat)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits of Async communication</h2>
<p>The benefits of async communication are many:</p>
<ul>
<li>ü§îPeople are allowed to think more deeply about their responses which leads to higher quality ones and less "hot takes"</li>
<li>ü§êPeople that would normally be timid in meetings have a voice</li>
<li>üéßThey support "Deep work". Nobody gets left out because they couldn't make the meeting or they were focusing instead of checking Slack</li>
<li>üìñContext is always available. A person can read over the discussion to get caught up without needing people to constantly re-cap old discussions</li>
<li>üíæDecisions are documented so they can be referenced in the future</li>
<li>üò¥They are timezone friendly. Many times people in other timezones (think Brazil, Austrailia) are 2nd class because they can't make all the meetings or a discussion happens in Slack while they are sleeping</li>
</ul>
<h2>So you mean&nbsp;<em>just <a href="https://justgage.github.io/slack.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> people more</em>?</h2>
<p>So when we're talking about "Asynchronous Communication" we mean that each person&nbsp;<em><strong>doesn't have be present at the same time</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This is important because Slack is often is thought of as "asynchronous" but in reality it's often quite hostile to it. Why? Well&nbsp;<a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">many</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://ux.useronboard.com/slack-i-m-breaking-up-with-you-54600ace03ea" rel="noopener noreferrer">reasons</a>, but let's start with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you're not&nbsp;<strong>paying attention all the time, you won't be able to have your say when something comes up</strong>. And since conversations happen quick, and then scroll away on the conveyor belt, if you're not at your station when it's your turn to speak, you won't get a chance later.</em><br>
Slack conversations are <a href="https://justgage.github.io/real-time.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real-time</a> and usually multiple topics share the same channel. This means that if you don't type up your reply quick somebody else might change the topic, or not give you time to speak. The chance increases the more people that you include in the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Tips for being better at <a href="https://justgage.github.io/async.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Async</a></h2>
