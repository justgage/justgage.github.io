        <h1>Learning <a href="http://localhost:5000/tachyons.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tachyons</a></h1>
<p><a href="http://localhost:5000/tachyons.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tachyons</a> is perhaps my favorite library I've ever found. I'm not even joking. Basically <a href="http://localhost:5000/tachyons.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tachyons</a> means that I'm able to almost never write real css again. It just lets me create. It's like a magic paintbrush that 90% of what comes out of it is beautiful. The rest requires a little skill.</p>
<p>However I think a lot of people bounce off of <a href="http://localhost:5000/tachyons.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tachyons</a> at first blush. Perhaps it's the wireframey look of the website (at least near the top) but more likely it's the copious amounts of long strings of abreviated names.</p>
<h2>What happened <code>.button</code>?</h2>
<p>Well for one thing you don't have to give up "symantic" names entirely. I'm some cases your design is so uniform it makes sense making a global decision about things. However this is rarely the case. Much more often things I'm your app should <em>look cohesive</em>, having the same fonts, colors and similar spacing and size meaning they look like they go together. However, they rarely are exactly the same.</p>
<p>You're kidding yourself if you can specify the margin of anything and never change it. You may think that all the buttons look the same but just take a look around your app and I bet you'll find quite the large amount of variants.</p>
