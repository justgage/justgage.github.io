        <h1>Doing things the fun way</h1>
<p>I loved playing with toys as a kid, however when I was done I hated having to put them away. It was so boring, yet my parents seemed to be quite emphatic about it's importance, stepping on legos and all. So I came up with a compromise! <strong>What if I could play with my toys <em>while</em> I put them away?!?</strong> My main method would be to would put a toy on a racecar then race it around the room ultimately placing it in the toy bin. I theorized that I could repeat this process till all the toys were put away and would enjoy myself much more.</p>
<p>My parents were not too impressed though. My productivity when it came to putting away toys may have been <em>more fun</em>, but it turns out putting a single toy away one-by-one slowly rather than grabbing handfuls as fast as I could was a lot slower. Despite this I had a really hard time seeing <a href="https://justgage.github.io/busy_and_fun_are_not_productive.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">this productivity gap</a>.</p>
<p>Not only that, but when you're having fun it's hard not to get distracted by the coolness of the toy I was putting away. Hence the mystery was solved of why my parents would come back <em>just in time to see me put a toy in the bucket</em> (despite the rest of the room looked exactly the same).</p>
<p>While this may seem to be only a childish feeling, kids are easily distracted and use fun as their fuel but I believe Adults aren't all that different. We <em>all</em> like to do things the <em>fun way</em> rather than the <strong>productive way</strong>, especially when we <em><strong>don't realize</strong> it's any slower.</em> And we probably won't because <strong>time passes more quickly when we're having fun</strong>.</p>
