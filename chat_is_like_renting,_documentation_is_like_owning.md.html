        <h1>Chat is like Renting, Documentation is like Owning</h1>
<p>When deciding to Rent V.S. Buy a home it's hard to really know which you should chose. Let's talk about some of the <a href="http://localhost:5000/tradeoffs.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">tradeoffs</a>.</p>
<h2>Rent</h2>
<p>At first Renting seems awesome! You're provided with ultimate flexibility! You don't need to go through a complex process to get a loan and sign all the paperwork, you just have to sign a year contract which is far easier. And when it's time to move you can easily just switch houses without having to find a buyer. You're only tied down by your contract and even that is often negotiable.</p>
<p>You also have less responsibility of the home itself broken things will often be fixed by the owner with just a call.</p>
<p>So what's not to love?</p>
<h2>Owning</h2>
<p>Well the hard thing is that renting is <a href="http://localhost:5000/trading_now_for_the_future.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">trading now for the future</a>, which is usually very bad. It's an instance of <a href="http://localhost:5000/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 Habits of Highly effective People</a> Sure, you may be paying less due to all the housing taxes, repair costs, and other fees BUT You're <em><strong>not making long term investment</strong></em>, all that money is going to the owner, not you. You could be giving up <strong>hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years.</strong> And when you're house is paid off your payments will be <em>GONE</em>.</p>
<h2>Slack is like renting</h2>
<p><a href="http://localhost:5000/slack.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> is kind of like renting in terms of <a href="http://localhost:5000/documentation.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> and <a href="http://localhost:5000/asynchronous_communication.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asynchronous Communication</a>. It's fast and quick now, <em><strong>but</strong></em> trades the future for the present. When you could have be talking in a way that <em>builds</em> up a information, you're using quick throwaway chats that aren't useful at all to future employees or even future you.</p>
