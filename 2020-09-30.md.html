<li>Overall I felt about this response that I was kind of being shut down and told to only be a programmer. I don't want to be "just a programmer". Admittedly this is just my feeling, he did say very explicitly that my ideas were welcome, but still it felt like I was being punished for sync not happening for the last couple of years, which wasn't my fault. I know he just wants focus but it does kind of suck. I think I'm not being really rational, but still, that's just my feelings.</li>
