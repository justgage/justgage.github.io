        <h1>Why Elm is good for us.</h1>
<h2>1. JavaScript is hard to keep maintainable over time</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you try to refactor things you rely on the fact that you can <code>ag</code> it effectively.</li>
<li>Runtime exceptions are hard to find</li>
</ul>
<p>Elms solves this because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It pushes all runtime exceptions to compile time</li>
<li>When Refactoring it's easy to know if it broke something, it's a compile time error</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. <a href="http://localhost:5000/elm.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elm</a> is simpler than JavaScript + all the frameworks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Elm is a small language, far smaller than JavaScript</li>
<li>Elm has React and Redux built in. There's no question on which framework to use or any temptation to stray from the right path</li>
<li>You have to be a lot less disciplined to keep your code working.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Elm has better tooling than JavaScript</h2>
<h2>4. Compile time is shorter</h2>
<p>Compiling all the JavaScript code takes forever, Elm is a lot faster which would aid in developer productivity.</p>
<h2>4. It's a lot less setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>There's no standard way to set up a React project. It's hard to wire everything together</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Added benefits</h2>
<p>The time traveling debugger even works with side-effecting things. This makes QAing a lot nicer.</p>
