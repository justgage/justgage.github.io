        <p>You're Insufficiently Persuasive - Sandi Metz</p>
<ul>
<li>I should read how to win friends and influence people
<ul>
<li>It's really about how to pretend people are interesting and eventually you might find them so, but in a very kind way</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Drive</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you try to pay them more to work better</p>
<ul>
<li>Works awesome if it's very mechanical</li>
<li>As soon as it's creative at all it makes you worse</li>
<li>You just need to pay people enough to get it off the table</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What drives us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autonomy: we want to control our own lives</li>
<li>Mastery: get better at things</li>
<li>Purpose: we want to have meaning, work for something bigger than ourselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>üëÜexplain Open Source software</p>
<h2>What if you're really not <em>right</em>?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We desire the same <em>ends</em> but have chosen different <em>means</em> (the way we do it)
<ul>
<li>You are not good at collaboration ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
<li>Teams innovate faster, and have better results, etc...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project Aristotle</h2>
<ul>
<li>Looking at each individual will not predict high performing teams from low performing ones</li>
<li>Emotional Intelligence of <em>Groups</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>KEY FACTOR: How you treat one-another (Psychological Safety)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Speak roughly in the same proportion (EVERYONE GETS A SAY)
<ul>
<li>If only one person dominated, or a few, the average IQ declined</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Average social Sensitivity
<ul>
<li>non-verbal queues</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Safe for "Interpersonal Risk taking"</p>
<ul>
<li>Sense of Confidence that they won't embarrass you for speaking up</li>
<li>Trust &amp; Respect to allow people to be themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Words about the past are usually about blame... you should probably avoid them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Words about the future about corrective action, it's about what's next</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should have strong opinions but they should be weekly held</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should have an identity, but keep it small. Don't bind yourself with the straight jacket of your past</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What is it that prevents us from sincerely making them like us? From winning them over?</p>
<h1>You are good enough</h1>
<p>"YOU'RE PURPLE" -&gt; no strong reaction, you're not secretly afraid that you're purple
"You are not your code, you're not your past, you're not your parents, and you're not responsible for everything"</p>
<ul>
<li>When you pop the "Why can't we come to an agreement?" stack right to the bottom you come to is FEAR üò∞</li>
</ul>
<p>Change the future</p>
<p>we are hardwired to collaborate</p>
