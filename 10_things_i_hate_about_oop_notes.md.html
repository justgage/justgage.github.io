<p>OOP is that it isn‚Äôt a paradigm like procedural, logic or functional programming. Instead, OOP says ‚Äúfor every problem you should design your own paradigm‚Äù</p>
<p>Obviously this seems like a bad idea. This means everything requires the reader to learn your new ad-hoc paradigm</p>
<p>OOP is about taming complexity through modeling</p>
<p>"We thought that OO conferences like ECOOP, OOPSLA and TOOLS would last for 4 or 5 years and then fade into the mainstream"</p>
<ul>
<li>shouldn't it? If it's so hard to do right is there a way?</li>
</ul>
<p>"Clearly classes should be great. Our brain excels at classifying everything around us. So it seems natural to classify everything in OO programs too.</p>
<p>However, in the real world, there are only objects. Classes exist only in our minds."</p>
<p>Classes shouldn't be as real as they seem in object oriented code. The fact that changing a class causes a huge ripple of change throughout our code seems to indicate they aren't what they say they are</p>
