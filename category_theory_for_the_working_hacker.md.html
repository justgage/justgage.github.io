        <h1>Category Theory for the working Hacker 🐷</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>A category where a morphism is a relation between objects: the relation of being less than or equal. Let’s check if it indeed is a category. Do we have identity morphisms? Every object is less than or equal to itself: check! Do we have composition? If a &lt;= b and b &lt;= c then a &lt;= c: check! Is composition associative? Check! A set with a relation like this is called a&nbsp;preorder, so a preorder is indeed a category.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Function is a morphism or called an ➡
There is a 🐈 egory  that contains all sets called Set</p>
<p>Void is a set with nothing in it, no values</p>
<p>There's one with only one unit represented as ()</p>
<p>A preorder is a category where there is at most one morphism going from any object a to any object b</p>
