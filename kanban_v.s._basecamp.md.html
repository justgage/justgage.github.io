        <h1>Kanban V.S. Basecamp</h1>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://justgage.github.io/kanban_boards_and_motivation.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanban Boards and Motivation</a> it seems to me that they are very poor. They basically always look the same, there's very little visible progress, there's always a lot of stress looking at the backlog which is usually <em>years</em> worth of work. There's no end, no beginning, only work.</p>
<p>Here's an illustration of what I see:</p>
<p><img src="https://justgage.github.io/pasted_image_20201204094302.png" alt="Pasted image 20201204094302"></p>
<p>I honestly thing that none of the motivation actually comes from the kanban board itself. I think most <a href="https://justgage.github.io/agile.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agile</a> relies heavily on the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/stand-up.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stand-up</a> providing the validation and the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/stress.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stress</a> of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/accountability.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accountability</a>.</p>
<p>But without that, people devolve into <a href="https://justgage.github.io/dumb_ticket_takers.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">dumb ticket takers</a>, and get <a href="https://justgage.github.io/burn_out.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burn Out</a> from <a href="https://justgage.github.io/neverending_sprints.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neverending Sprints</a>. By not doing <a href="https://justgage.github.io/stand-up.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stand-up</a>, we are [[Predictably Irrational - basic human motivations: Dan Ariely at TEDxMidwest|de-motivating by ignoring]].</p>
<p>However, Stand-ups are a very heavy process. They are a form of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/synchronous_communication.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synchronous Communication</a>, <a href="https://justgage.github.io/never_interupt_a_programer_comic.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">interupt the programmer</a>, and provide no <a href="https://justgage.github.io/papertrail.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">papertrail</a> or <a href="https://justgage.github.io/documentation.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> and generally are anti-<a href="https://justgage.github.io/remote_work.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote work</a>.</p>
<p>Doing some <a href="https://justgage.github.io/meeting_math.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meeting Math</a>, you can see how heavy they are in terms of time at least:</p>
<pre><code>Number of People * Minutes = Actual Length of the Meeting

5 * 30min = 2 1/2 hours (per day)
5 * 30min * 5 days = 12 hours or 1 1/2 days lost!
</code></pre>
<p>That said, <strong>we can motivate without stand-ups!</strong></p>
<h2>Motivation Without Stand-ups</h2>
<p>To be truly motivating, I feel like a <a href="https://justgage.github.io/project-management.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">project-management</a> tool HAS to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Project Oriented: Show <em>visible</em> progress on a bigger project getting DONE!</li>
<li>Social: People get to get validation for what they've done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basecamp provides these two things</p>
<h3>A visible Project</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://justgage.github.io/basecamp.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp</a> projects are first class! They are something you can SEE and something that will eventually be DONE.
<img src="https://justgage.github.io/pasted_image_20201204095713.png" alt="Pasted image 20201204095713"></p>
<p>Then I can compartmentalize and go into a <em>single</em> project and think about that without the stress of everything else that I need to do!</p>
<p><img src="https://justgage.github.io/pasted_image_20201204094822.png" alt="Pasted image 20201204094822"></p>
<p>Looking at a "scope" of the project (a smaller piece that can be completed independently) it doesn't look so bad!
<img src="https://justgage.github.io/pasted_image_20201204092129.png" alt="Pasted image 20201204092129"></p>
<h3>A Social Place</h3>
<p>Basecamp doesn't separate <a href="https://justgage.github.io/project_management_is_about_communication.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">project management and communicaiton</a>, but rather binds them together. This has the effect of making it much more social (and therefore motivating) and it also means that projects and todos get updated much more frequently!</p>
