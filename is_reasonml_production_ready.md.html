        <p>Is ReasonML production ready?</p>
<p>This is a bit of a silly question I'm my opinion, because it's a little vauge what it actually means.</p>
<p>Basically they are saying:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do other big companies invest in it enough to ensure that it's never going to just become unsupported</li>
<li>Has it got enough libraries so that I don't have to invest very much to do my daily tasks reinventing the wheel? Are these libraries got stable and active maintainers?</li>
<li>How many gotchas and rough edges does it have? Will I run into issues that I can't solve easily?</li>
<li>Can I be more productive than JavaScript?</li>
<li>Has the syntax and best practices been estblished?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok that's a lot of questions, let's try to answer them in turn.</p>
<p>The real question is are <em>you</em> ready to use Reason in production. Remember there's always a trade-off of innovation and stability. Stability only comes from people using it a lot. Admittedly a language as strict as ReasonML is going to more quickly find issues so long as they aren't using more risky features like binding to JavaScript.</p>
