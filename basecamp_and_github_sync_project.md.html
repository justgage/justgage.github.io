        <h1>Basecamp and Github Sync Project</h1>
<p>This is a project to use Code Review Live and my Basecamp Elixir Library to sync the two</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Github Projects is a <a href="https://justgage.github.io/kanban_boards.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanban boards</a> with <a href="https://justgage.github.io/neverending_sprints.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neverending Sprints</a>. This is bad for team <a href="https://justgage.github.io/kanban_boards_and_motivation.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">modivation</a>.</p>
<p>Also slack is a huge source of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/topic_fragmentation.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">topic fragmentation</a> and <a href="https://justgage.github.io/context_indepedent_messages.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">lack of context</a> added to Issues where they belong.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://justgage.github.io/basecamp_discourages_communication_fragmentation.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp discourages communication fragmentation</a> and encourages <a href="https://justgage.github.io/documentation.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> which helps us understand stuff.</p>
<h2>Measure of Success</h2>
<p>If Paul has no idea we're using BC, it's always up to date (because BC naturally makes sure things are up to date).</p>
<p>A final goal is that comments are</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Linking Step</strong>: Look for all the tasks that aren't linked in the DB and link them</li>
<li><strong>Reactive</strong>: When you check off a Basecamp todo then it will drag the card to the right in <a href="https://justgage.github.io/basecamp_projects.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp Projects</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Rabbit holes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>These are a bunch of simplifying decisions that will help people not waste too much time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard to know which of the two sources is more up to date. Ways we can get around this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PR's status always wins</strong></li>
<li><strong>One directional Sync</strong>
<ul>
<li>Manually pick direction? (Mix task)</li>
<li>Board always wins because that's what we want to make sure is always up to date</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Only reactive</strong>: When you get a webhook or people comment with magic commands.</li>
<li><strong>No Webhooks for Github</strong>: These aren't super hard to do perhaps but would complicate things and the GraphQL endpoint is much easier to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's hard to know that a Github thing is connected to a Basecamp thing. How do we solve this problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the links in the DB
<ul>
<li>Manually link them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for BC todos with a link to a Github thingy</li>
<li>Look for tasks with the same name</li>
<li>If you can't find it, create a new BC todo in an "unscoped" category</li>
</ul>
<h2>No-gos</h2>

<p>These are things that we've explicitly fenced of as things we're not going to do.</p>
