<p>The position was because it contextually congruent with the previous note.</p>
<p>Lumann said that just because a slipcard was linked to another by being next to it didn't make that relationship any stronger than writing on a card. This is probably good in his system because his ids were sequential which means they couldn't be moved once placed.</p>
<p>I personally feel like maybe that "positionality" could represent that one ideas is building on another as opposed to just being "related".</p>
