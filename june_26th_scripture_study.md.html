        <h1>June 26th Scripture study</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“He saved others; himself he cannot save” (Matthew 27:42)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this was said because they didn't understand the atonement I think there's a lesson in this. Jesus healed everyone else, but never healed himself. He was able to command the sea but he didn't stop his tormenters.</p>
<p>I think that maybe this is why the preisthood works this way, Jesus was trying to tell us something. He was trying to tell us to help others in all circumstances. Not to think of ourselves, but think of others.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I'm not sure I'm crazy good at that currently. I think I could be a lot better.</p>
