<ul>
<li>$1000 cash for Ernest money</li>
<li>If they end up breaching the contract this is what you get from them.</li>
<li>Not great, but all they have</li>
<li>They will probably want the dishwasher replaced, maybe a credit for how much we'd pay for one.</li>
<li>Settlement is when you sign the documents</li>
<li>Closing when EVERYTHING is done, everyone's got their money, it's on the county records. (usually 24h later after settlement).</li>
<li>They want to move in ASAP after settlement.
<ul>
<li>Settlement Deadline <strong>Oct 29th 2020</strong>
<ul>
<li>They don't want to pay for another month's rent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>~7 weeks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Oct 9th</strong> is their finical appraisal line
<ul>
<li>They are using Utah housing loan, which is a bit more of a risk.</li>
<li>They loose $1,000 and we loose a month in a half</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Their Recommendation: $3,000 earnest money and maybe move the deadline up (could help us pay for a month or two of rent)</li>
<li>~$1,500 for policy</li>
<li>Get HOA documents.</li>
<li>"Due Diligence": time for the buyers to <strong>do any tests they want to do</strong> to make sure it's good, the tub drains, electricity, etc...
<ul>
<li>They have to pay for the tests</li>
<li>If they find anything, they can cancel the contract and they get their earnest money back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They could do an appraisal and find that the home isn't worth as much as we are selling it for</li>
<li>$500 Home Warranty (for things like dishwashers and stuff, but not ours)</li>
</ul>
