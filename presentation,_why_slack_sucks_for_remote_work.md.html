        <h1>Presentation, why Slack SUCKS for remote work</h1>
<h3>I didn't want to talk about Slack... but I must</h3>
<hr>
<h2>I can no longer ignore the problems with it.</h2>
<p>not that I've tried much...</p>
<hr>
<h1>Slack sucks for Remote work</h1>
<p>There... I said it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<p>Because it wasn't built for it.</p>
<hr>
Slack was built to remotely tap people on the shoulder
<p>it's a, "Joe isn't sitting at his desk" problem.</p>
<p>Like when you're at home, enjoying your family.</p>
<hr>
<p>Well if it sucks so much... why do people use it?</p>
<hr>
<p>Simple, it's better than email.</p>
<hr>
<p>Email sucks for the following reasons:</p>
<hr>
<h3>1) Email is FILLED with "spam"</h3>
<p>newsletters, app engagement, marketing). 99% of email clients do nothing to stop this.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2) Email isn't transparent</h3>
<p>meaning the only way to get information is to have people send it to you. This means a lot of silos.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3) Dear listener, Email caused people to be overly formal, Sincerely Gage.</h3>
<p>People started noticing problems with it...</p>

<p>I‚Äôm finding that ‚Äúalways on‚Äù tendency to be a self-perpetuating feedback loop: the more everyone‚Äôs hanging out, the more conversations take place. The more conversations, the more everyone‚Äôs expected to participate. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>

<p>99 inboxes, take one down pass it around...

<hr>
<p><strong>supreme irony</strong>: While it has replaced the tyranny of email for many, it has unleashed a chaotic tyranny of its own.
<br></p>
<p>Posts and their responses pour in so fast that even</p>
<h3><strong>being away from Slack for a couple of hours</strong> can leave you <strong>feeling hopelessly behind</strong>.</h3>
<hr>
<h3>How fast you can glean information from this?</h3>

<h3>What about this?</h3>

<h1>Instant is problem</h1>
<hr>
<p>People think it's all the rage...</p>

<p>Yet it leaves you feeling like this</p>

<p>Slack made the writer happy üòå</p>
<p>Now you can get answers <em>sooo much faster!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>But... the reader far less ü•µ</p>
<p>Now you have to answer <em>soo much faster!</em></p>
<hr>
<h1>The Solution: An App that supports <em>real</em> threaded conversations</h1>
<hr>
<p>Slack threads are better than nothing...</p>
<hr>
<p>But they don't solve the real problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to be given us a space to fully discuss complex ideas and projects from start to finish
to give more meaningful feedback
to promote transparency in our decision-making
and to disconnect to do the deep work that we‚Äôre truly excited about.
