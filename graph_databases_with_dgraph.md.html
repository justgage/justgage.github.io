<h2>What is Dgraph?</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://justgage.github.io/dgraph.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dgraph</a> is an open source, distributed, graph database... let's pick that apart
<ul>
<li>Graph
<ul>
<li>Nodes and Edges (Things and Relationships)</li>
<li>Each node can point to another node or a "value" such as a string, integer, etc...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Database
<ul>
<li>Stores values long term</li>
<li>Has guarantees about integrity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distributed
<ul>
<li>Automatically handles spreading the work of storing and querying across multiple servers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's a Graph Database? Or Why don't I just use Postgres?</h2>
<p>Relational databases compute their joins at runtime using an index. Every time you have to do a join you have to lookup right before you do it. They also require you to be very explicit about your data model before you store it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever you run the equivalent of a JOIN operation, the database just uses this list and has direct access to the connected nodes, eliminating the need for a expensive search / match computation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What's so cool about Dgraph</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It aims at being <strong>an every day driver</strong> of a database that's just easier to use, yet still fast.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It makes joins as simple as breathing, and <em>all</em> your data normalized. This means that there's almost no <code>nulls</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Did I mention it's free and open source?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Other reasons:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Helps you understand GraphQL better</li>
<li>More natural way to express many complex ideas</li>
<li>Can be faster to do many joins</li>
<li>Query language is much more friendly than SQL for many things.</li>
<li>Most permissive of all data structures, you can model trees, linked-lists,  maps, or singletons easily.</li>
<li>There's no way to make a big table, everything must be broken up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's not so cool about Dgraph</h2>
<ol>
<li>It's kind of in <em>beta</em> status. It just nearly turned 1.0. Don't expect it to replace Postgres just yet.</li>
<li>As such there's not a Ruby or Elixir client that's 100% up to date (although it wouldn't be hard to write one)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Re-learning to model data</h2>
<p>What if you took all your tables and broke them up into little pieces till they where just a big pile of cells, they take those cells and draw lines between them to show their relationships with each other. This is what you do with Graph databases.</p>
<p>Things you don't need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rows, Columns, Schema's</li>
<li>Join Tables, etc...</li>
</ol>
<h2>Query language 101</h2>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<ul>
<li>Show how it can solve problems we have, on big data.</li>
