        <h1>HEY's ethical, paid design gives it an advantage over Gmail</h1>
<p>The main designer of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/basecamp.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp</a> and <a href="https://justgage.github.io/hey.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">HEY</a>, <a href="https://justgage.github.io/jonas_downey.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonas Downey</a>, said this <a href="https://twitter.com/jonasdowney/status/1329167477633331200" rel="noopener noreferrer">on twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main takeaway: your business model is the foundation of all the product decisions you make. If you start with a respectful business model and an ethical mindset, <em>you will be able to build things that other companies can't</em> (because they're <a href="https://justgage.github.io/beholden_to_investors.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">beholden to investors</a> or ad revenue.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This gives you a competitive advantage. For example, it'd be hard for Gmail to adopt  <a href="https://justgage.github.io/hey.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">HEY</a>'s Screener feature, because the whole point is to reduce the email you get.</p>
<p>But Gmail wants you looking at MORE email so they can show you ads. <strong>The two models are fundamentally opposed</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So <a href="https://justgage.github.io/gmail.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gmail</a> is <a href="https://justgage.github.io/selling_attention.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">selling attention</a> which means that it's NEVER going to avoid you getting too many emails, or help you check it less!</p>

<h2>Business Model Based on Manipulation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When you're designing a product, think about who you're putting first: your customers (the real people using it), or your business?
<br>
If you can't put people first without also hurting your business, <strong>then your <a href="https://justgage.github.io/business_model_is_probably_based_on_manipulation.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">business model is probably based on manipulation</a></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Growing big is often bad for the world</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We also have to change our framing for what "business success" means. Growing a company to Facebook's scale looks great on a balance sheet, but it's provably bad for the world. Unicorn growth is a mutant aberration, not the norm. We must aspire to simple sustainability instead.</p>
