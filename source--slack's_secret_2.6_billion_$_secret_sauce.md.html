<h2>Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When you hear people talk about Slack they often say it‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù. Using it doesn‚Äôt feel like work. It feels like slacking off, even when you‚Äôre using it to get stuff done. But when you look under the hood, it‚Äôs almost identical to every other chat app. You can create a room, add people, share files, and chat as a group or direct message one another. So, what makes Slack different?</p>

The difference? Vibrant colors, a curvy sans-serif typeface, friendly icons, and smiling faces and emojis everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone caught on to "Fun design", but it's too late</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past couple months, their competitors have caught on. They‚Äôve all started using casual copy and trying to bone up on design, but it‚Äôs a little like your uncle trying to do the macarena. It‚Äôs too little too late. Everyone has picked their robot sidekick. Slack has stolen the show.</p>

<h2>My Take-away</h2>
<p>Slack was designed to be fun, nothing wrong with that, but I would argue it often does it at the mercy of focus and thoughtfulness. I'm not saying I would rather have "work is always about work!", I don't think that's true, yet I do think it can be taken too far, and Slack did..</p>
<p>Have you ever had a friend that's a class clown? They are <em>always</em> cracking jokes, and they are super fun and funny to be around, but you can never have a serious conversation with them? Never really feel like you <em>know</em> them. Slack feels like that, except it's not just one person it's like a house party constantly going on at work. No serious conversation won't be punched in by a kitten shooting lasers from it's eyes. Slack is like.a [[Source--Why I Hate Slack and You Should Too#Threads don't work because of rabid bull of real-time chat|rabid bull]] of fun.</p>
