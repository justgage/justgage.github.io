title: Slack doesn't have a back burner</h2>
<p>Slack is kind of the brains of an organization, but unlike a real brain it can't mull things over a long period of time or even remember them for longer than a day or two. Sure it stores stuff, it does that like crazy, but it doesn't really, "remember" things in any useful way. The knowledge is there, in cold storage, but isn't anywhere near the surface. It's never going to come up unless stored in our collective brains. Ideas can't grow past infancy in here. All day is a brainstorming session, never a deep dive.</p>
