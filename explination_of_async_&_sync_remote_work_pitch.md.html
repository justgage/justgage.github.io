        <h1>Explination of Async &amp; Sync Remote work Pitch</h1>
<p>*Note: this was notes taken from a note taking session on my iPad where I recorded myself trying to talk through Remote work... these are the notes</p>
<p>Recording: <a href="https://share.icloud.com/photos/0FwE7egFQvvDLCXMSsqklnjjA" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://share.icloud.com/photos/0FwE7egFQvvDLCXMSsqklnjjA</a></p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a difference between <a href="https://justgage.github.io/posting_v.s._messaging.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Posting V.S. Messaging</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://justgage.github.io/notion.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notion</a> doesn’t work because it’s not a “publish / subscribe” model, meaning it doesn’t know when people should be notified or not, so it just defaults to “always, whenever an edit is made under a subtree”</li>
<li><a href="https://justgage.github.io/synchronous_communication.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synchronous Communication</a>
<ul>
<li>IS FAST: is nice because it’s fast and all the people get the message immediately. But is bad because it fragments the collective day making the time less useful.
<ul>
<li>NOTE: you have to convince people that following the “manager’s schedule” is not OK for programmers or designers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is distracting
<ul>
<li>People don’t want to distract others so they make things more private</li>
<li>Now that information is Private it lowers the involvement people can have in decision making which lowers people’s <a href="https://justgage.github.io/motivation.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motivation</a> and “buy in” to the process.
<ul>
<li>See also: [[Predictably Irrational - basic human motivations: Dan Ariely at TEDxMidwest]]</li>
<li>People don’t operate as well when they are just a “cog in the wheel” or they’re being fed tickets with little context about the value they are adding in the real world</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Doesn’t support lots of people
<ul>
<li>Lots of people can’t talk at once because the discussion is bound by time and how fast people can consume it, if they run out of time they will, skim or do “unread bankruptcy”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Doesn’t support multiple topics
<ul>
<li>Topics have to “live in time” and in a “room” which means you have to be in the room (place)  while it’s happening (time)
<ul>
<li>Often in sync conversations you have to either lock down which topic is talked about or you’ll end up with a “wandering conversation”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creates <a href="https://justgage.github.io/fomo.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">FOMO</a> and lacks <a href="https://justgage.github.io/information_stability.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information Stability</a></li>
<li>Days get fragmented when multiple "bring up a thought" schedules overlap
<ul>
<li>Async allows for more of a <a href="https://justgage.github.io/maker's_schedule_v.s._managers_schedule_--_by_paul_gram.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programmer's schedule</a></li>
</ul>
