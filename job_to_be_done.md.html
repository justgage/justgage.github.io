<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>Good interview questions:
Jobs To Be Done Questions to Ask:
Unlike other kinds of interviews, you don‚Äôt need to always ask every question in the exact same order. These are all just ways to explore the process of their purchase and help them remember their story.</p>
<ul>
<li>When did you first start thinking about your purchase?</li>
<li>Was it in the morning or evening? What time was it?</li>
<li>Where were you when you made that decision?</li>
<li>Was anyone else involved in the purchasing decision?</li>
<li>Why?</li>
<li>Visualize the environment you were in when you made the decision to purchase‚Ä¶where were you? What was around you?</li>
<li>Tell me more about that‚Ä¶(When you hear something interesting/intriguing)</li>
<li>Did you consider any competitors? Which ones? Why?</li>
<li>Why didn‚Äôt you choose them?</li>
<li>How did you decide between what you bought and the other options?</li>
<li>Why specifically did you buy that day versus any other? Why then? What was unique about that day?</li>
<li>What else were you doing that day?</li>
<li>Did anyone contribute to sparking the decision that day? Why?</li>
<li>What were you using before you had X?</li>
<li>Why did you use that? What did you like about it?</li>
<li>When did you start using that?</li>
<li>What were its shortcomings?</li>
<li>What does the new product do that your old solution couldn‚Äôt?</li>
<li>How do you normally approach choosing a new product?</li>
<li>What was your process for this product?</li>
<li>Why was it the same/different this time?</li>
<li>How do you use the product you‚Äôve purchased?</li>
<li>Are there features you use all the time? How?</li>
<li>Are there features you never use? Why not?</li>
