        <h2>Sketchbooks</h2>
<p>This is interesting because <a href="http://localhost:5000/murphy.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Murphy</a> recently started calling these, "Sketchbooks", I like the way he put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a place for documents that exist as chronologically structured, largely unedited stream of consciousness from the brain of a developer while working on a particular issue. I call them sketchbooks, because they make me think of the notebook and pen an artist carries with them out into the world when they go out to observe and learn about the world. They produce sketches that help them learn about the shape, form, and color of the things they see. Sometimes the sketches are great, but mostly they are messy &amp; full of mistakes. They are the means to the end of greater learning. Think of these documents as messy sketches produced while learning. We keep them around so that they can be referenced later if another developer happens to come upon the same problem again and needs inspiration from past work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of <a href="http://localhost:5000/drawing_isn't_like_a_printer.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawing isn't like a printer</a>, even though it's not the same idea, it's just interesting how much drawing is a good analogy for things.</p>
<p>Overall I think this is interesting but also feel like if you <a href="http://localhost:5000/talk_in_context.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk in context</a>, namely under a Todo in <a href="http://localhost:5000/basecamp.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp</a> and Under a PR or Issue in <a href="http://localhost:5000/github.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>. Saving these away in an unstructured list is better than <a href="http://localhost:5000/slack.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> because it's not <a href="http://localhost:5000/topic_fragmentation.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">topic fragmentation</a> and it's not <a href="http://localhost:5000/rushing_means_you_don't_care.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">rushed</a>. But at the same time feels like it would be very hard to find in the future. Namely, I think it lacks <a href="http://localhost:5000/information_discoverability.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information Discoverability</a>.</p>
