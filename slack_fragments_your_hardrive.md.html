        <h1>Slack fragments your hardrive</h1>
<p>Fragmented hardrives are when one file is stored across many places. This makes it hard for the computer to find and retrieve quickly, yet it would often happen on Windows because by default it would put files super close together and if one grew it would be forced to split up the file into multiple places. You could defragment the hard drive but this takes forever because of how disorganized the information is stored by default. This is due to poor organization.</p>

<p>Unix computers solved this problem by just putting a file in the biggest possible space on the hard drive so it could grow if it needed to without running into another file.</p>
<p>Slack does this too by forcing you to put information in a <a href="https://justgage.github.io/small_amount_of_categories_that_are_infinitely_deep.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">small amount of categories that are infinitely deep</a> which means that information just can't live in the right place, there's just too few categories. Also, this means that it lives in DMs due to people being <a href="https://justgage.github.io/shy_of_public_channels.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">shy of public channels</a>.</p>
