        <h1>Blank Check Projects</h1>
<p>When you have a "Blank Check Project" you can expect the amount of time we spend on it to be <strong>very high</strong> because the cost isn't <a href="http://localhost:5000/betting.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">capped</a>. This is because there's no <a href="http://localhost:5000/timebox.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">timebox</a> to prevent any <a href="http://localhost:5000/scope_creep.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">scope creep</a> that comes along.</p>
<p>The only thing that will every make the project get done is if stakeholders get impatient (and the programmers use it) for a feature which then puts the stress and pressure a timebox would have given.</p>
<p>It's tempting to think, "you can't rush quality", but I think it's a little flawed, <a href="http://localhost:5000/constraints_are_good_for_focus_and_creativity.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">constraints are good for focus and creativity</a>, if you don't have them anything can be put into your sprint. If you're allowed to go in all directions you'll make less progress then if you go in one (see: <a href="http://localhost:5000/essentialism.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Essentialism</a>).</p>
<p>While it's counter-intuitive to <a href="http://localhost:5000/timebox.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">timebox</a> things, I think it's very important.</p>
<p>Note, I'm not saying that we never extend a project, but I do think that by making it too easy we're asking for a lot of runaway train kind of projects.</p>
